- include in documentation

  - using supabase cli (fetch types)

- planning on using:
  - supabase auth
    - good way to see if you can swap in another auth provider
  - supabase edge functions? or vercel edge functions?
    - probably vercel because its easier to swap out with another provider
- pages needed:
  - /auth/sign-in
  - /auth/sign-up
